Programmed by:   Albert Chan and Andrew Xue
Programmed on:   May 26, 2019
Programmed for:  ICS3U1-04
Purpose:         Create the main file to run our air hockey game. This main file contains the program for the
                 user interface of the game. From the main menu the user is able to view the rules of the game,
                 quit the program, and select their choice of level. After selecting their level the user will
                 be able to pause the game, resume the game, and quit the game. Each game lasts for 3 minutes
                 and the players will control their paddles with either the WASD keys or arrow keys. Throughout
                 the game the user will be able to see the score and time remaining. After the 3 minutes of the
                 game are over, the user will be able to see who won or if it was a tie game.
